/*
 Pros:
 1. Lookup operations are done in O(1)
 2. Inserting into a dictionary is always O(1).
 1. Order is maintained
 2. Constant access time O(1)
 
 Cons:
 1. Order is not maintained
 2.
 1. Inserting at the middle / front of the array needs shifting of remaining element after the insertion index. Inserting to the front is the worst case
